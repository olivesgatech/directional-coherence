Some codes have a few bugs that I tried to document.
I didn't have time to fix these bugs, or to 'clean' the code. 

Please be aware of this while using the code. 


The main code used in the paper is: directional_coherence_timesection.m


To run the code, you will need to download tensorlab (http://www.tensorlab.net/)
